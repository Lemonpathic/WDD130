    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this site is to help teachers in an education world that can be confusing to navigate amidst the
        new rise of GPT technology. Teachers will be able to submit student essays and our technology will create a confidence
        score for the teacher to use in their grading. This will help teachers to be more confident in their grading!

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Teachers, mainly in the high school, middle school level where cheating is to be more prominent many teachers are worried
        about students using AI to create their essays. Sadly mainly truthful students are also being punished, AI recognizers
        are not very sound, most even say that the Bible was written completely my AI. Now that is not fair to fail students using
    a faulty device. So let's fix that</p>
