    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Teachers, mainly in the high school, middle school level where cheating is to be more prominent many teachers are worried
        about students using AI to create their essays. Sadly mainly truthful students are also being punished, AI recognizers
        are not very sound, most even say that the Bible was written completely my AI. Now that is not fair to fail students using
    a faulty device. So let's fix that</p>

        <h2>Why GPTeacher?</h2>
        <p>You might be wondering why you need GPTeacher when there are already many tools that can check for plagiarism or grammar errors. The answer is simple: GPTeacher is different from other tools because it uses the latest advances in artificial intelligence to analyze the content, structure, and style of student essays. Unlike other tools that can only detect copied or poorly written text, GPTeacher can evaluate the originality, coherence, and creativity of student essays.</p>

        <h2>How GPTeacher Works</h2>
        <p>GPTeacher is based on ChatGPT, a powerful chatbot that can generate human-like text on almost any topic. ChatGPT is trained on a large corpus of text from the internet, including academic papers, news articles, blogs, and books. ChatGPT can answer questions and generate text based on a given prompt.</p>
        <p>GPTeacher uses ChatGPT to create a confidence score for each student essay. The confidence score is a measure of how likely it is that the essay was written by a human student and not by a chatbot or another source. The confidence score is calculated by comparing the student essay with a text generated by ChatGPT on the same topic and prompt. The more similar the two texts are, the lower the confidence score is. The less similar the two texts are, the higher the confidence score is.</p>
