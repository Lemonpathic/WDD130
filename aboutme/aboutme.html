    <h1>All About Me</h1>
    <h2>I am <strike>Ironman</strike> Bryan Wilson</h2>
    <p>
        My name may remind you of the beach boys singer! But it isnt that. Nor is it derived from a family member.
        My dad just loves cars. My middle name is <b>Marcus</b> so my initials are BMW.
    </p>
    <h2>My Major</h2>
    <p>Not only did my dad have an influence on my name but also on what I want to study. My dad is a CS major and
        I blame him for my love of computers. So of course since I love computers CS is the route I am going down.
